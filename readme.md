# Social Media Cards With FeatherHTTP

Image manipulation libraries are awesome, but so is HTML and CSS!

Use ASP.NET Core FeatherHTTP and Playwright to generate social media cards.

## Getting Started

Currently, this application is targeting .NET 5 but probably works with .NET Core 3.1.

The program takes two arguments: 

- 0 : Title
- 1 : Image Url 

```console
dotnet run "Hello, World" "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555532538-dcdbd01d373d?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1731&q=80"
```

When run, the application will make a call to a Razor Page (Index.cshtml). Feel free to change it for your needs.

The final output will look something like this.

![hello, world](./hello-world.png)
